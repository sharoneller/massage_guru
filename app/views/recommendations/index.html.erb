<h2>Wondering what type of massage is best for you?</h2> 
<h3>Please allow us to bestow some massage wisdom upon you.</h3>

<h3> But, first, we need to know what symptoms you are experiencing. </h3>

<p>
	Please choose one symptom:
  <%= form_tag(recommendations_show_recommendation_path, method: "get", action: "show_recommendation") do %>
  <%= select_tag "symptom", options_from_collection_for_select(@symptoms, "id", "name") %> 
  <%= submit_tag("Get Recommendation", :class => "my-btn my-btn-primary") %>
<% end %>
